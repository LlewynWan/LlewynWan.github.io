I'm a final year PhD candidate at City University of Hong Kong, supervised by Professor [Yuhan Luo](https://yuhanlolo.github.io/me/), and previously Professor [Zhicong Lu](https://luzhc.github.io/). My current research is focused on the intersection between creativity support, human-AI collaboration, and social computing. Specifically, I seek to understand the impact of AI on creative activities, unravel broader social implications, and design new paradigms and workflows to support human-GenAI co-creativity. I'm also broadly interested in other topics such as responsible AI, affective computing, and personal informatics.

Besides HCI research, I love reading philosophy.
