I'm a final year PhD candidate at City University of Hong Kong, supervised by Professor [Yuhan Luo](https://yuhanlolo.github.io/me/), and previously Professor [Zhicong Lu](https://luzhc.github.io/). My current research explores the intersection between creativity support, human-AI collaboration, and social computing. Specifically, I seek to understand the anthropomorphized role of GenAI in creative thinking process, unravel downstream implications of co-creative activities such as storytelling in personal informatics, and design new paradigms and workflows to support human-GenAI collaboration.

Besides HCI research, I love reading philosophy.

Through the design of [***Polymind***](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09577), we explored the potential of parallel collaboration with multiple mixed initiative agents on a visual diagramming canvas. To operationalize parallel collaboration, we borrowed design metaphors from groupware such as microtasks.

[***Metamorpheus***](https://dl.acm.org/doi/full/10.1145/3613904.3642410) is an affective interface that engages users in a metaphorical dream narration for affective mindfulness and self-reflection. Our evaluation found the co-creation of metaphorical visual stories helped articulate ineffable emotions, created a sense of connnectedness between creators, and motivated dream sharing.

In an [**empirical study**](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3637361) with 15 participants, we identified three theoretically-grounded stages of co-creativity during prewriting with GPT-3.
